# Software Building Process and Associated Roles

# Three most common development methodologies

Mentioned Three development methodologies:

1. Waterfall
2. V-shape Model
3. Agile

## Waterfall

One phase’s output -> input of next phase

Customer does not see the final product until the testing phase

Typically long

Pros:

1. understand, well-defined responsibility
2. Easier to estimate budget and resources

Cons:

1. Lacks of flexibility
2. Change is hard to accommodate

## V-shape Model

📉 左边下坡：开发阶段 的结构

- 是一个**由抽象到具体**的过程：从"我想要一个系统"到"这段代码怎么写"
- 每往下一层，就更细节、更接近代码
- 所以图形自然是"向下走"

📈 右边上坡：测试阶段

- 是一个由具体到抽象的回归验证过程
- 每一级测试都回头对应左边的开发阶段
- 所以图形是"向上走"，并与左边形成对称配对

🔁 底部连接点：Coding

- 左边的"设计"与右边的"测试"都以代码为中心汇聚和发散
- 是开发与验证的"交点"
- 所以自然形成了字母 **V** 的结构

Pros:

- Easy
- Test plans save testing time

Cons:

- Rigid - more rigid than waterfall
- Does not accommodate changing requirements at all - no change!

## Angil

Iterative approach

Each phase is short

1-4 weeks long each cycle

Sprint Demo: after each cycle, stakeholders can see new functions and feedback

MVP release after several cycles

MVP: minimum viable product

Agile Manifesto:

outline 4 cores

1. Individuals and interactions > Processes and tools
2. Working software > comprehensive documentations
3. Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation
4. Responding to change > Following a plan

Pros:

- Flexible
- Feedback incorporate regularly
- module

Cons:

- Budget and resource are unclear
- Project scope is not defined
