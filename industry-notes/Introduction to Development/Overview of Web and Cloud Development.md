# Overview of Web and Cloud Development

Understanding how websites and cloud applications work will guide your learning path as a web developer.

---

## **1. How Browsers and Servers Interact**

- **Browser**
    - Examples: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
    - User enters a URL (e.g., www.IBM.com) in the address bar
- **Request/Response Cycle**
    - Browser sends a request to the server
    - Server returns:
        - **HTML**: Page structure
        - **CSS**: Styling and layout
        - **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic behavior

---

## **2. Static vs. Dynamic Content**

- **Static Content**
    - Pre‑stored on server
    - Delivered unchanged to every user
- **Dynamic Content**
    - Generated on each request
    - Often fetched from databases or other services
- **Typical Websites** use a mix of both for performance and personalization

---

## **3. Cloud Applications**

- Similar request/response model to websites
- Built on cloud infrastructure for:
    - **Scalability** (elastic compute and storage)
    - **Resilience** (redundancy, failover)
- Leverage cloud‑native services for data processing and storage

---

## **4. Front‑End vs. Back‑End**

### **Front‑End (Client‑Side)**

- Everything the user sees and interacts with
- Core technologies:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Related libraries and tools

### **Back‑End (Server‑Side)**

- Server logic and functionality before sending data to client
- Responsibilities:
    - Business logic
    - Authentication & security
- May involve:
    - Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    - NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB)

### **Full‑Stack Development**

- Combines both front‑end and back‑end skills
- Enables end‑to‑end project work

## **5. Developer Tools**

- **Code Editors / IDEs**
    - Code editing, building, compiling, debugging
    - Git/GitHub integration
    - Extensions and theming
- **Popular Choices**
    - Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans
